Project title:
Finderskeepers

What and why?
Have you ever procrastinated until the last second, or have forgotten a homework that requires you to print something last minute? In comes finderskeepers, an application which allows you to find a variety of resources nearby or near a specific location such as a school. This application is useful for students (and really anyone) who may not have access to necessities such as wifi, printers, computers, or even just a quiet place to study for a couple of hours that isn't your room. 

Some important features that will be included:
- There will be a system similar to yelp, in that businesses or places can recieve ratings by students based on the services they provide. 
- Ideally there will be a space for students and for teachers/schools on the app. A person can log in as a student or teacher, and depending on your role, you will have different options. 

Scope
We believe the app to be accomplishable by the end of the semester. We will be using technologies wildly available to make the task easier in a sense, such as api's and web scraping. There will be a set number of resources we can include and this number will be clearer as we being to make progress on the app.
