# Project Proposal
### Project title

Study Buddy

### What and why?

We would like to build a web app that allows students to quickly and easily find nearby locations that can supply useful services such as printers, wifi, or group study areas. This app would also allow students to review and rate locations that they have visited, which would encourage more places to be student friendly and let students find places best suited to their needs. Teachers could create research hubs on the platform to give their students a list of places near the school that are helpful.

### For whom?

The target demographic of this web app are students, specifically those who are underprivileged and often don't have access to things like printers, free wifi, or a quiet place to study.

### How?

The student would be able to login and search based on filters for what they need to find. For example, a quick printing service or somewhere to sit down with free wifi. Cafes, libraries, and locations would have their own postings, which can be scraped from the web. Keywords such as "quick printing" or "free wifi" could be gathered from other student reviews or the location's posting. Teachers would also have a login where they can create their own collection of locations and resources that their students would find useful. This is 3 portals (student, organization/location, and teacher). The web scraping aspect of this project is mostly about finding a way to automate the process of getting organization data and their descriptions.

### Scope

The main challenge of building this webapp has three steps: building the actual UI for the three user types, scraping the web for organization data, and implementing the rating/review/collection features. There are no complicated graphics features or systems that would cause us to get stuck and we are doing minimal features that are feasibly done by a group in a limited time.
